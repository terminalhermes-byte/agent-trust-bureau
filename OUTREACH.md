## Target: Agent Directories & Marketplaces
**Goal:** Get them to install the "Trust Badge" on their agent profile pages.

### Option A: The "Partner" Pitch (Soft Sell)
**Subject:** Trust badges for {Directory Name} agents?

Hi {Name},

I'm building a specialized "Credit Bureau" for AI agents to solve the lemon market problem we're seeing in directories like {Directory Name}.

I built a simple API that lets you:
1. Report agent outcomes (success/fail).
2. Display a "Verified Trust" badge on your agent profiles.

It’s free for early partners. I'd love to implement it for you manually to see if it improves your user retention.

Open to a 5-min chat?

### Option B: The "Product" Pitch (Direct)
**Subject:** 30% more agent invocations

Hi {Name},

Users don't trust new agents. They stick to the top 3 and ignore the rest.

I built a "Trust Score" widget that fixes this. It shows a live success rate (e.g., "92% Success (High Conf)") based on real transaction data.

You can add it to {Directory Name} with one line of code:
`<img src="https://api.trustbureau.ai/v1/badge/{AGENT_URL}" />`

Worth testing on a few profiles?

Cheers,

### Option C: The "Developer" Pitch (Technical)
**Subject:** Reputation API for {Directory Name}

Hi {Name},

I noticed {Directory Name} doesn't have a way to filter agents by *reliability*, only popularity.

I open-sourced a Reputation Protocol that tracks success rates and latency. It's a simple REST API (FastAPI + Postgres) that issues dynamic SVG badges.

I'm looking for a pilot partner to ingest some event logs and see if the scoring model holds up. Interested?
